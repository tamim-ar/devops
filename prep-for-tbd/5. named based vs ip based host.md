Here's a comparison between **Name-based** and **IP-based** hosting:

| Feature                | Name-based Hosting                         | IP-based Hosting                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**         | Multiple domains share the same IP address | Each domain has its own IP address      |
| **Server Requirement** | Single IP for many domains                 | Unique IP for each domain               |
| **Virtual Hosts**      | Identified by domain name (Host header)    | Identified by IP address                |
| **SSL Certificate**    | One SSL per IP (unless SNI is used)        | Easily supports separate SSL per domain |
| **Cost**               | Cheaper (fewer IPs needed)                 | More expensive (more IPs required)      |
| **Configuration**      | Easier to set up with modern servers       | More complex to manage many IPs         |
| **Use Case**           | Shared hosting, small to medium sites      | Dedicated hosting, SSL-heavy sites      |
