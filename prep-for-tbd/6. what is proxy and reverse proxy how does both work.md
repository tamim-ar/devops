Here’s a simple breakdown of **proxy** and **reverse proxy**, how they work, and their differences:

---

### 🔁 **Proxy (Forward Proxy)**

**What it is:**
A server that sits between **client** and the internet.

**How it works:**

1. Client sends a request to the proxy.
2. Proxy forwards the request to the destination server.
3. Response is returned to the proxy, which sends it back to the client.

**Use Cases:**

* Hiding client identity (IP)
* Bypassing geo-restrictions or firewalls
* Content filtering in organizations
* Caching to improve performance

**Diagram:**

```
Client → Proxy → Internet (Server)
```

### 🔄 **Reverse Proxy**

**What it is:**
A server that sits between the **internet** and **backend servers**.

**How it works:**

1. Client sends a request to the reverse proxy.
2. Reverse proxy decides which backend server should handle the request.
3. Backend server responds to the reverse proxy.
4. Reverse proxy forwards the response to the client.

**Use Cases:**

* Load balancing
* SSL termination
* Caching static content
* Protecting backend servers

**Diagram:**

```
Client → Reverse Proxy → Backend Server(s)
```
