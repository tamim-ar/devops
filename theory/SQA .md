**Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** is a set of activities that ensures the quality of software products and processes during the entire software development life cycle (SDLC). Its primary goal is to ensure that the developed software meets and complies with the defined or standardized quality specifications and requirements.

### üîç **Key Aspects of SQA**

#### 1. **Definition**

SQA involves **systematic processes and practices** that monitor and improve the software development process, ensuring:

* Fewer bugs or defects
* Higher reliability
* Better performance
* Compliance with standards

### üß± **Components of SQA**

| Component                  | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quality Planning**       | Defining quality goals and planning how to meet them.                     |
| **Quality Control (QC)**   | Identifying defects in the actual product through testing.                |
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | Monitoring the process to ensure quality is being built into the product. |
| **Process Improvement**    | Continuously improving the development and testing process.               |

### üîÅ **SQA in SDLC Phases**

| SDLC Phase     | SQA Activities                                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements   | Ensuring clear, complete, and testable requirements.             |
| Design         | Reviewing system architecture and design documents.              |
| Implementation | Code reviews, static analysis, and development best practices.   |
| Testing        | Manual and automated testing to verify and validate the product. |
| Deployment     | Ensuring proper deployment procedures and rollback plans.        |
| Maintenance    | Monitoring software behavior post-release, bug fixing.           |
