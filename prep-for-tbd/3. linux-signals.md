# Linux Signals

Linux signals are a form of inter-process communication used to notify processes about events asynchronously.

## What are Linux Signals?

- Signals are software interrupts sent to a process to notify it of various events.  
- They can be sent by the kernel, other processes, or the process itself.  
- Signals can cause a process to stop, terminate, ignore, or handle the event using a custom signal handler.

## Common Signals

| Signal Name | Number | Description                         |
|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| SIGINT      | 2      | Interrupt from keyboard (Ctrl+C)  |
| SIGTERM     | 15     | Termination signal                 |
| SIGKILL     | 9      | Kill signal (cannot be caught)    |
| SIGSTOP     | 19     | Stop process                      |
| SIGCONT     | 18     | Continue process after stop       |
| SIGSEGV     | 11     | Segmentation fault                |
| SIGHUP      | 1      | Hangup detected on controlling terminal |

## Signal Handling

- Default actions: terminate, ignore, stop, continue  
- Processes can catch signals and define custom handlers  
- Some signals (e.g., SIGKILL, SIGSTOP) cannot be caught or ignored

## Useful Commands

- `kill -SIGNAL PID` — send a signal to a process  
- `trap` — define a handler for signals in shell scripts  
- `ps` — check running processes and their status
