DevOps is a combination of "Development" and "Operations." Itâ€™s a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that aims to:

* **Bridge the gap between software development and IT operations**
* **Improve collaboration and communication**
* **Automate and streamline** the software delivery process

### Goals of DevOps:

* Faster development cycles
* More frequent releases
* Reliable and stable systems
* Quick detection and resolution of issues

### Key Practices:

* **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically merging and testing code.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automating release processes.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure through code.
* **Monitoring and Logging**: Tracking performance and bugs.
* **Automation**: From testing to deployment.

### Common DevOps Tools:

* **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
* **Containers**: Docker
* **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
* **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Ansible

### Summary:

DevOps helps teams build, test, and release software **faster and more reliably** by encouraging collaboration and automating as much as possible.
