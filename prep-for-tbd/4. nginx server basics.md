Certainly! Here's a concise overview of the basics of the NGINX web server, based on the official [Beginner's Guide](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html):

---

## üß∞ What is NGINX?

NGINX is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It's designed for handling high concurrency, serving static content, and acting as a reverse proxy for dynamic content.([Wikipedia][1])

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Configuration

NGINX's configuration file, typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, is structured into directives that define its behavior. Key sections include:

* **`worker_processes`**: Defines the number of worker processes.
* **`events`**: Configures event handling.
* **`http`**: Contains directives for HTTP server configurations.([Nginx][2], [NGINX Docs][3])

## üöÄ Starting and Stopping NGINX

To start NGINX:([Hostinger][4])

```bash
sudo nginx
```



To stop NGINX:([Medium][5])

```bash
sudo nginx -s stop
```



To reload the configuration without downtime:([Nginx][2])

```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```



---

## üåê Serving Static Content

To serve static files, configure a server block like:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```



This setup serves files from `/usr/share/nginx/html` when accessing `http://example.com`.

---

## üîÑ Reverse Proxy Setup

To set up NGINX as a reverse proxy:([Medium][5])

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}
```



This configuration forwards incoming requests to a backend server running on `localhost:8080`.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è FastCGI Integration

NGINX can interface with dynamic content generators like PHP via FastCGI:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /usr/share/nginx/html$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```



Ensure that a FastCGI server (e.g., PHP-FPM) is running on the specified address.([Nginx][2])

---

## üîÑ Reloading Configuration

After making changes to the configuration file, reload NGINX to apply them:([Status List][6])

```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```



This command gracefully reloads the configuration without dropping connections.
