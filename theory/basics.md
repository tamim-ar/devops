# DevOps Theory Fundamentals

## Core Concepts
1. Continuous Integration (CI)
2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
4. Microservices Architecture
5. Containerization

## DevOps Lifecycle
1. Plan
2. Code
3. Build
4. Test
5. Deploy
6. Operate
7. Monitor

## Best Practices
- Automation First Approach
- Version Control Everything
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and Logging
- Security Integration (DevSecOps)

## DevOps Culture
- Collaboration between Dev and Ops teams
- Shared responsibility
- Continuous feedback loops
- Blameless post-mortems
- Knowledge sharing

## Key Metrics
1. Deployment Frequency
2. Lead Time for Changes
3. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
4. Change Failure Rate
5. System Availability
6. Application Performance

## Essential Tools Categories
1. Source Control Management
2. Build Tools
3. Configuration Management
4. Deployment Tools
5. Monitoring Solutions
6. Testing Frameworks

## Documentation Practices
