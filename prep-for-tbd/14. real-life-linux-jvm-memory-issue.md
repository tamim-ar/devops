**real life problem solved in linux environment: java memory issue**

### background

while working on a production server hosting a java-based web application, we started facing frequent **out of memory** errors. the application would become unresponsive during peak traffic, and logs showed `java.lang.outofmemoryerror: heap space`.

the environment was a **linux ubuntu server**, and the application was deployed using **apache tomcat** with a **jvm** backend.

---

### problem

* application crashed randomly under load
* `catalina.out` and app logs showed heap memory issues
* server had sufficient ram (16gb), but java wasn’t using it efficiently
* default jvm memory settings were too low

---

### steps i took to solve it

#### 1. **verified the jvm settings**

checked the startup script:

```bash
ps aux | grep java
```

saw low heap values:

```
-Xms256m -Xmx512m
```

---

#### 2. **monitored memory usage**

used:

```bash
top
htop
free -m
```

verified ram availability.

---

#### 3. **analyzed gc logs and heap dumps**

enabled garbage collection logs in tomcat:

```bash
-XX:+PrintGCDetails -Xloggc:/var/log/tomcat/gc.log
```

reviewed patterns: too many full gcs, low survivor space, heap size too small.

---

#### 4. **increased jvm heap memory**

edited `setenv.sh` in tomcat’s `bin/` directory:

```bash
export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1g -Xmx4g -XX:+UseG1GC"
```

* `-Xms1g` → initial heap 1gb
* `-Xmx4g` → max heap 4gb
* `-XX:+UseG1GC` → better garbage collection

---

#### 5. **restarted tomcat**

```bash
./shutdown.sh
./startup.sh
```

---

### result

* no more memory errors
* app handled peak traffic smoothly
* monitored for a week — stable performance
* tuned heap based on actual usage from jvm monitoring

---

### key learnings

* always monitor jvm memory usage under real load
* default jvm memory settings are often too low for production
* gc logs and heap dumps are powerful tools
* linux gives great visibility via command-line tools
