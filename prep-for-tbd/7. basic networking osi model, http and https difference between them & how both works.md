**basic networking – osi model, http vs https**

---

### osi model (7 layers)

1. **application** – user interface (e.g., browser, http)
2. **presentation** – data formatting & encryption (e.g., ssl/tls)
3. **session** – manages connections (e.g., login session)
4. **transport** – reliable delivery (e.g., tcp, udp)
5. **network** – routing (e.g., ip)
6. **data link** – physical addressing (e.g., mac address)
7. **physical** – actual hardware transmission (e.g., cables, signals)

### http (hypertext transfer protocol)

* used to transfer data (html, images, etc.) between client and server
* works over **port 80**
* no encryption → data is sent in **plain text**

**how it works:**

1. browser sends a request to server (e.g., GET /index.html)
2. server responds with data (e.g., html page)
3. communication is stateless (no memory of past requests)

---

### https (http secure)

* http + **ssl/tls encryption**
* works over **port 443**
* encrypts data between client and server → **secure connection**

**how it works:**

1. browser connects to server
2. ssl handshake happens (exchange of public keys)
3. encrypted session is established
4. then http data is transferred securely

### http vs https – key differences

| feature       | http                    | https                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| security      | not secure              | encrypted (ssl/tls)      |
| port          | 80                      | 443                      |
| data transfer | plain text              | encrypted data           |
| trust         | no lock icon in browser | lock icon shows trust    |
| performance   | slightly faster         | slightly slower (secure) |
