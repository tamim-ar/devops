**real life linux problem – fixing java memory issue**

i worked on a java application running on a linux server. users reported the app was crashing during high traffic.

### problem

* app crashed with `outofmemoryerror`
* logs showed low heap memory
* server had enough ram, but jvm wasn’t using it

### solution

1. checked current jvm settings:

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep java
   ```

   found: `-Xmx512m`

2. edited tomcat's `setenv.sh` file:

   ```bash
   export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xms1g -Xmx2g"
   ```

3. restarted tomcat:

   ```bash
   ./shutdown.sh
   ./startup.sh
   ```

### result

* no more crashes
* memory usage improved
* app ran smoothly during traffic
