DevOps is a collaborative approach that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance the speed and quality of delivering software applications and services. By fostering a culture of shared responsibility, automation, and continuous improvement, DevOps aims to streamline the software development lifecycle, enabling organizations to respond more swiftly to market changes and customer needs.([ManageEngine][1])

### ðŸ”§ Core Principles of DevOps

1. **Collaboration and Communication**: Breaks down silos between development and operations teams, promoting a culture where all stakeholders work together throughout the entire application lifecycle.([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])

2. **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks such as code integration, testing, and deployment to reduce errors and increase efficiency.

3. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Ensures that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, facilitating rapid and reliable software releases.

4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Implements real-time monitoring and logging to gather feedback, allowing teams to proactively address issues and improve system performance.

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manages and provisions infrastructure through code, enabling consistent and scalable environments.([Wikipedia][3])
