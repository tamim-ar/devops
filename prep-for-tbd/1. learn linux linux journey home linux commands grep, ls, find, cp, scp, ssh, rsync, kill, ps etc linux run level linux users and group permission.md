# learn linux – basic commands & concepts

---

## linux journey: home

* start with terminal basics
* understand file system hierarchy `/`, `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`
* basic navigation: `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`
* file operations: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`

---

## linux commands

* `grep` – search text inside files
* `ls` – list directory contents
* `find` – find files and directories by name, type, etc.
* `cp` – copy files and directories
* `scp` – secure copy files over ssh
* `ssh` – secure shell remote login
* `rsync` – fast file transfer and sync
* `kill` – terminate process by PID
* `ps` – list running processes

---

## linux run level

* defines state of the machine and what services run
* common runlevels:

  * 0 – shutdown
  * 1 – single user mode (maintenance)
  * 3 – multi-user text mode
  * 5 – multi-user graphical mode
  * 6 – reboot

## linux users and groups

* every user has uid and belongs to groups
* groups manage permissions for multiple users
* commands:

  * `useradd`, `usermod`, `userdel` – manage users
  * `groupadd`, `groupmod`, `groupdel` – manage groups
  * `id` – show user and group ids
  * `groups` – show groups a user belongs to

## linux permissions

* files have permissions for user, group, others
* types: read (r), write (w), execute (x)
* `chmod` – change permissions
* `chown` – change file owner
* `chgrp` – change group ownership

Here’s a concise guide covering all the topics you mentioned, with examples in **English**:
