**security basics**

### what is security?

security refers to protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.

---

### types of security

* **network security** – protects network infrastructure
* **application security** – secures software applications
* **information security** – protects data confidentiality, integrity, availability
* **endpoint security** – protects devices like laptops and phones
* **cloud security** – secures cloud-based infrastructure and services

---

### cia triad

1. **confidentiality** – only authorized access to data
2. **integrity** – ensure data is not altered
3. **availability** – data/services available when needed

---

### common threats

* malware (viruses, worms, ransomware)
* phishing (fake emails/websites to steal data)
* man-in-the-middle (intercepting communication)
* ddos attacks (flooding servers to crash them)
* sql injection (malicious queries in input fields)
* cross-site scripting (xss)

---

### best practices

* use strong, unique passwords
* enable two-factor authentication (2fa)
* keep software and systems updated
* back up data regularly
* use firewalls and antivirus software
* apply least privilege principle
* monitor systems and review logs

---

### encryption

* **symmetric encryption** – same key for encrypt/decrypt
* **asymmetric encryption** – public/private key pair
* **hashing** – one-way encryption (e.g., passwords)

---

### authentication vs authorization

* **authentication** – verifies user identity
* **authorization** – grants access to resources

---

### basic tools

* antivirus and firewall
* wireshark (network monitoring)
* nmap (port scanning)
* burp suite (web security testing)
* fail2ban (ssh brute force protection)
